### HW1: Entire website
The HW1 represents the entire website, the website is divided into two parts, one is dedicated to visitors and the other one is dedicated to users(students , tutors and teachers).
The file "universit_.sql" is the database export that I used

## Disposal
This HW1 is divided into so many folders, each of them contains the main files for each page of the website.

## Installation
First of all download all the files. If you want to see the code you have to open the .php and the .css and the .JS with your favorite editor. Also, if you want to see the GUI, you have to make a folder, put all the files in the folder and put the folder in C:\xampp\htdocs. Then you should open Chrome and type in the search-bar "localhost/FolderName/FileName.php".

## Roadmap
4th step of 5.
